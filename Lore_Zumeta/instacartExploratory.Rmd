### Order products

`order_products__*.csv`

These files specify which products were purchased in each order.

```{r}
dbGetQuery(sc, "SELECT * FROM order_products__prior_tbl LIMIT 10")
```
 
## orders

`orders.csv`

This file tells to which set (prior, train, test) an order belongs. 


```{r}
orders_prev <- dbGetQuery(sc, "SELECT * FROM orders_tbl LIMIT 100")
orders_prev
```
 
```{r}
dbGetQuery(
  sc,
  "
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT product_id) AS products
FROM order_products__prior_tbl
  "
  )
```

```{r}
products_popularity_txt <- "
SELECT product_id
,   COUNT(1) AS n_orders
FROM order_products__prior_tbl
GROUP BY product_id
ORDER BY n_orders DESC
LIMIT 50
"

products_popularity <-
  dbGetQuery(sc, products_popularity_txt)

## Products

* For 10 first users and all their orders find days since first order. (CHALLENGING)

```{r}
orders %>% # we are executing sparklyr
  filter(user_id <= 10) %>%
  select(user_id, order_number, days_since_prior_order) %>%
  arrange(user_id, order_number) %>%
  mutate(days_since_first_order = cumsum(days_since_prior_order)) %>%
  mutate(days_since_first_order=ifelse(is.null(days_since_prior_order), 0, days_since_first_order))
```
Now using HIVE SQL (Google-n idatzi hive window functions, )
```{r}

        days_since_first_order

    order_number
